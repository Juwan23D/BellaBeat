# BellaBeat Wearable Insights
I took on the role of a junior data analyst for Bella Beat, and analyzed smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The purpose of my analysis was to help guide future marketing strategies for Bella Beat so they can properly promote their devices to their targeted audience. 
Along the way, I performed numerous real-world tasks that involved using the data analysis process to expand my way of perceiving data, and helping Bella Beat gather useful data driven information.
